 ### :cactus: Branches

 I use an agile continuous integration methodology, so the version is frequently updated and development is really fast.

1. **`stage`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.
